                <p>Most Î±-particles passed straight through the gold foil without any deflection, which meant that there was a lot of empty space in an atom.</p>

                <strong class="text-green-300">Presence of Nucleus:</strong>
                <p>A few Î±-particles were deflected through small angles, which meant that there was a positively charged region present in the atom that caused deflection. Rutherford called this positively charged region the nucleus of the atom.</p>

                <strong class="text-green-300">Density and Mass:</strong>
                <p>Very few Î±-particles were deflected through large angles or bounced back, which meant that the nucleus is centrally located, dense, and occupies a very small space in the atom. The Î±-particles that directly hit the nucleus bounced back. Since Î±-particles which were comparatively denser were deflected by the nucleus, Rutherford concluded that almost the whole mass of the atom must be present in the nucleus.</p>
